    <h1>Hi Friend!</h1>
    <p>I'm Lindsay, a software engineer who recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly.
    </p>
    <p>I'm passionate about conservation, animals and crafting. Basically, I want to save the world one needle felted narhwal at a time (if you aren't familiar with needle felting, I highly suggest you check it out!). </p>
    <p>I hope you like what you see!</p>
    <p>Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:urchykli@gmail.com">urchykli@gmail.com</a>. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
